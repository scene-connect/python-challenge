# Scene Python coding challenge
A technical interview challenge for python developers.


## Getting started
You will need:
- git
- python (>=3.11)
- poetry (`pipx install poetry` is easiest)

You should be able to checkout this repository, and setup a virtual environment using
poetry:
```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
```

### Running the Django server
From a shell within the poetry virtual environment:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

By default that will run on port 8000.
